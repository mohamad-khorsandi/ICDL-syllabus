### ‚å®Ô∏è **Introduction to 10-Finger Typing**

### üßë‚Äçüè´ **How to Master 10-Finger Typing**

1. **Proper Hand Placement:**
   - Place your **left hand** on the home row (`A S D F`).
   - Place your **right hand** on the home row (`J K L ;`).
   - **Fingers should rest lightly on the keys**: Left pinky on `A`, left ring finger on `S`, etc.
   - The **thumbs** should rest on the space bar.
2. **Correct Finger Usage:**
   - Each finger is assigned specific keys.
   - The left hand handles the left side of the keyboard, and the right hand handles the right.
   - For example:
     - Left index finger: `F G T H`
     - Right index finger: `J K Y U`
3. **Don‚Äôt Look at the Keyboard:**
   - The key to improving is muscle memory, so **keep your eyes on the screen**, not the keys.
4. **Practice Regularly:**
   - Typing consistently and practicing proper technique will make you faster and more accurate.
5. **Use All Fingers Efficiently:**
   - Try not to use the same finger for multiple keys, and **minimize** hand movement.
