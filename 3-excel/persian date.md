 **month/day confusion** in Excel is one of the most frustrating things

## 📅 Why Does Excel Consider the First Number as the Month?

Because Excel uses your **Windows regional settings** to decide how to interpret date formats. That means:

- If your system is set to **U.S. locale**, Excel sees `04/05/2025` as:
  - **MM/DD/YYYY** → April 5, 2025
- If you're in **most of the world (like Europe, Iran, etc.)**, you expect:
  - **DD/MM/YYYY** → 4 May, 2025

But Excel doesn’t "guess" — it just follows your system.

## ⚙️ So… is it Excel’s fault?

Not really — it’s **Windows settings** underneath.

### ✅ You can check and change your region like this:

1. Go to **Windows Settings**
2. Search for **"Region"**
3. Click **Change data formats**
4. Change **Short date** to the format you want (`dd/MM/yyyy`, for example)

This affects Excel *and* other programs.
