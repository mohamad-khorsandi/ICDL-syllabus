### üß™ 1. **System Cleanup Script**

```
batCopy code@echo off

### üíª 2. **Create a Daily Backup Script**

xcopy "%USERPROFILE%\Documents" "D:\Backup\Documents" /s /i /y
echo Backup complete!
pause
```

‚úÖ Tip: Use `Task Scheduler` to run this daily.

------

### üì¶ 3. **Auto-Installer Script**

```
batCopy code@echo off
start /wait NotepadPlusPlusInstaller.exe /S

```
batCopy code@echo off
title Folder Locker
if EXIST "Private" (
  echo Folder already locked or exists!
  pause
  exit
)
md Private
echo Private folder created.
pause
```

Then create another file to rename/hide the folder and another to unlock. Let me know if you want the full version of the "locker" setup.

------
